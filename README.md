# How To Play:
 - Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD, or GoG install folder, to the DevilutionX game directory ; Make sure it is all lowercase.
 - [Download DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases), or build from source
 - Install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) (including [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) and [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/))
 - Run `./devilutionx`

Please keep in mind that this is still being worked on and is missing parts of UI and some minor bugs, see [milestone 1](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/milestone/1) for a full list of known issues.

</details>
<details><summary>Windows via Visual Studio</summary>

### Installing dependencies
Make sure to install the `C++ CMake tools for Windows` component for Visual Studio.

* **Using vcpkg (recommended)**
1. Install vcpkg following the instructions from https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start.

	Don't forget to perform _user-wide integration_ step for additional convenience.
2. Install required dependencies by executing the following command (via cmd or powershell):

	`vcpkg install sdl2:x86-windows sdl2-mixer:x86-windows sdl2-ttf:x86-windows libsodium:x86-windows`

	_Note: this command installs libraries compiled for x86 but it's not hard to do the same for x64 libraries if you need it_

* **Manually**
1. Download and place the 32bit MSVC Development Libraries of [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/), [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) and [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases) in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\`.
2. If dependencies are not found or you wish to place them in other location - configure required path variables in _"Manage Configurations..."_ dialog inside Visual Studio or in _cmake-gui_.

### Compiling

* **Through Open->CMake in Visual Studio**
1. Go to `File -> Open -> CMake`, select `CMakeLists.txt` from the project root.
2. Select `Build devilution.exe` from the `Build` menu.

	_Note: By default Visual Studio only creates configuration x64-Debug, to add the new configuration (e.g. x86-Debug) please click "Manage Configurations..." in combo box on the top and then on button with green plus to add a new configuration_

* **Through cmake-gui**

1. Input the path to devilutionx source directory at `Where is the source code:` field.
2. Input the path where the binaries would be placed at `Where to build the binaries:` field. If you want to place them inside source directory it's preferable to do so inside directory called `build` to avoid the binaries being added to the source tree.
3. It's recommended to input `Win32` in `Optional Platform for Generator`, otherwise it will default to x64 build.
4. In case you're using `vcpkg` select `Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling` and select the file `scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` from `vcpkg` directory otherwise just go with `Use default native compilers`.
5. In case you need to select any paths to dependencies manually do this right in cmake-gui window.
6. Press `Generate` and open produced `.sln` file using Visual Studio.
7. Use build/debug etc. commands inside Visual Studio Solution like with any normal Visual Studio project.

<details><summary>Haiku</summary>

### Installing dependencies on 32 bit Haiku
```
pkgman install cmake_x86 devel:libsdl2_x86 devel:libsdl2_mixer_x86 devel:libsdl2_ttf_x86 devel:libsodium_x86
```
### Installing dependencies on 64 bit Haiku
```
pkgman install cmake devel:libsdl2 devel:libsdl2_mixer devel:libsdl2_ttf devel:libsodium
```
### Compiling on 32 bit Haiku
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-x86 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-x86 -DBINARY_RELEASE=ON ..
make -j$(nproc)
```
### Compiling on 64 bit Haiku
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```
</details>

## CMake arguments
### General
The default build type is `Debug`. This can be changed with `-DBINARY_RELEASE=ON`. Independently of this, the debug mode of the Diablo engine is always enabled by default. It can be disabled with `-DDEBUG=OFF`. Finally, in debug builds the address sanitizer is enabled by default. This can be disabled with `-DASAN=OFF`.
You can also generate 32bit builds on 64bit platforms by setting `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../CMake/32bit.cmake` (remember to use the `linux32` command if on Linux).
### mingw32
Use `-DCROSS_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix` if the `i686-w64-mingw32` directory is not in `/usr`.
### Use SDL v1 instead of SDL v2.
Pass `-DUSE_SDL1=ON` to build with SDL v1 instead of v2.
Note that some features are not yet supported in SDL v1, notably upscaling, and fullscreen.

# Multiplayer
 - TCP/IP only requires the host to expose port 6112
 - UDP/IP requires that all players expose port 6112

# Modding
Below are a few examples of some simple improvements made to the game. It is planned in the future to create tools for designing dungeons and graphics.

# F.A.Q.
<details><summary>Click to reveal</summary>

> Wow, does this mean I can download and play Diablo for free now?

No, you'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternatively you can also use `spawn.mpq` from the [http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe](shareware) version and compile the with the SPAWN flag defined.
> Cool, so I fired your mod up, but there's no 1080p or new features?

We're working on it.
> What about Hellfire?

Hellfire was a bit of a flop on the developer's part. Support may come in the future once the base game is finished.
